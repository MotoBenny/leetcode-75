# #BigO

Big O describes the Upper bound of complexity the worst case scenario, how long in runtime will your algorithm take to complete the desired goal?

O(1) - Constant time, regardless of the size of the input data, your algorithm we resolve in the same amount of time

O(n) - 



## BigO Time


## BigO Space


## Constant time O(1)
The algorithm or process is always going to take the same amount of time to complete, regardless of the size of data or input.

## Linear Time O(n)
The amount of time ( #runtime ) the algorithm or process takes to complete or process grows with the size of the input data, Algorithms here grow linearly, depending on how many items are in the input dataset.
