# #BigO

Big O describes the Upper bound of complexity the worst case scenario, how long in runtime will your algorithm take to complete the desired goal?

O(1) - Constant time, regardless of the size of the input data, your algorithm we resolve in the same amount of time

O(n) - 



## BigO Time
Describes the amount of time it takes an algorithm to run - how 


## BigO Space
Describes the amount of memory space it takes an algorithm to run. 

## Constant time O(1)
The algorithm or process is always going to take the same amount of time to complete, regardless of the size of data or input.

## Linear Time O(n)
The amount of time ( #runtime ) the algorithm or process takes to complete or process grows with the size of the input data, Algorithms here grow linearly, depending on how many items are in the input dataset. Where (n) is the size of the input data. 
often refered to as bvrute force algorithms due to needing to interact with ever item of a dataset regardless of constraints. 

## quadradic time O()

## Logerithmic Time O(log n)
The run time increasses only by a small amount as N increases. When the size of N (the input dataset) doubles, the time complexity increases only a tiny ammount. As the input size grows the number of opperations grows very slowly alongside it. 

As a result Log(n) time is very desireable in an algorithm
